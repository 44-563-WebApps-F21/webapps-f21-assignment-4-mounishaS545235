        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>[_Leaning forward_.]</p>  <p>Don’t say that.</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>I do say it.  I feel it—I know it.</p><br/>

        <p>[_Enter_ PARKER _C._]</p><br/>

        <h5>PARKER.</h5>  <p>The men want to know if they are to put the carpets on the terrace for to-night, my lady?</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>You don’t think it will rain, Lord Darlington, do you?</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>I won’t hear of its raining on your birthday!</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>Tell them to do it at once, Parker.</p><br/>

        <p>[_Exit_ PARKER _C._]</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>[_Still seated_.]</p>  <p>Do you think then—of course I am only putting an imaginary instance—do you think that 
            in the case of a young married couple, say about two years married, if the husband suddenly becomes the intimate friend of 
            a woman of—well, more than doubtful character—is always calling upon her, lunching with her, and probably paying her 
            bills—do you think that the wife should not console herself?</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>[_Frowning_.]</p>  <p>Console herself?</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>Yes, I think she should—I think she has the right.</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>Because the husband is vile—should the wife be vile also?</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>Vileness is a terrible word, Lady Windermere.</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>It is a terrible thing, Lord Darlington.</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>Do you know I am afraid that good people do a great deal of harm in this world.  Certainly the greatest harm 
            they do is that they make badness of such extraordinary importance.  It is absurd to divide people into good and bad.  People 
            are either charming or tedious. I take the side of the charming, and you, Lady Windermere, can’t help belonging to them.</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>Now, Lord Darlington.</p>  <p>[_Rising and crossing R._, _front of him_.]</p>  <p>Don’t stir, I am merely going to finish 
            my flowers.</p> <p>[_Goes to table R.C._]</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>[_Rising and moving chair_.]</p>  <p>And I must say I think you are very hard on modern life, Lady Windermere.  
            Of course there is much against it, I admit.  Most women, for instance, nowadays, are rather mercenary.</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>Don’t talk about such people.</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>Well then, setting aside mercenary people, who, of course, are dreadful, do you think seriously that women 
            who have committed what the world calls a fault should never be forgiven?</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>[_Standing at table_.]</p>  <p>I think they should never be forgiven.</p><br/>

        <h5>LORD DARLINGTON.</h5>  <p>And men?  Do you think that there should be the same laws for men as there are for women?</p><br/>

        <h5>LADY WINDERMERE.</h5>  <p>Certainly!</p><br>
